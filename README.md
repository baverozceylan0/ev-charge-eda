# üöó EV-Charge-EDA

**Exploratory Data Analysis of EV Charging Session Data**, focused on large-scale electric vehicle charging facilities.  

üß™ This repository:
  - explores **usage patterns, user behavior, temporal trends, and engagement dynamics** using robust data preparation and statistical visualization methods.
  - serves as a foundation for EV load modeling, demand forecasting, and engagement segmentation.
  - provides replicable and consistent analysis across diverse EV charging datasets.
  - simplifies scaling to new datasets using a standardized schema and modular scripts.

## üß© Data Schema & Preparation

All analyses require a standardized **four-column** input dataframe:

| Column           | dtype              |
|------------------|--------------------|
| `EV_id_x`        | string            |
| `start_datetime` | datetime64[ns]    |
| `end_datetime`   | datetime64[ns]    |
| `total_energy`   | float64           |

The script `src/load_data.py` handles **formatting raw sources into this schema**, ensuring consistency across multiple datasets.

## üìö Key Analyses
Key features include:

- **Temporal analysis:**  
  - **Monthly trends** in arrival counts to detect stable/volatile periods.
  - **Daily session distributions** to assess operational consistency.

- **User-Level Analysis:**
  - Distribution of session counts per user.
  - Identification of one-time vs. recurring users.  
  - Pareto-like analysis of user engagement (e.g., top X% of users contributing Y% of sessions).  

- **Visualization outputs:**  
  - Clear charts for numerical and categorical features (histograms, boxplots, bar charts, heatmaps).  
  - Ready-to-use plots for inclusion in reports or further analysis.  

- **Univariate analysis:**  
  - Distributions of key numerical variables, including session duration, total energy delivered, start and end times, and average power.  
  - Distributions of categorical variables, including session counts by day of the week, and session counts by month of the year. 

- **Bivariate analysis:**  
  - Correlation heatmaps for numerical variables such as session duration, start and end times, and total energy delivered.  
  - Two-dimensional distributions (scatterplots) for key numerical relationships, e.g., start vs. end times or duration vs. total energy delivered.  
  - Box plots illustrating the distribution of session counts by day of the week and by month of the year.
